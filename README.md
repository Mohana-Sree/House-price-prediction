# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project predicts house prices based on key features like **square footage**, **bedrooms**, and **bathrooms** using a **Linear Regression** model.

---

## Problem Statement

> Implement a linear regression model to predict the prices of houses based on:
- Square footage (`sqft_living`)
- Number of bedrooms
- Number of bathrooms

---

## Dataset

We used the **King County Housing Dataset**, which includes house sale prices for King County, USA (Seattle area).

 File used: `house_price_dataset.csv`  
 Features used:
- `sqft_living`
- `bedrooms`
- `bathrooms`  
   Target: `price`

You can download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction)
The dataset name is kc_house_data.csv

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Google Colab**
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib** for visualization
- **Scikit-learn** for building and evaluating the ML model

## How to Run

1. Upload `house_price_dataset.csv` to Colab or clone this repo.
2. Run the notebook: `House-price-prediction.ipynb`
3. You can modify `new_house = [[sqft_living, bedrooms, bathrooms]]` to test predictions.

## Results

- Trained a Linear Regression model.
- Achieved good prediction accuracy on test data.
- Predicted price for a 2000 sqft house with 3 beds and 2 baths successfully.
